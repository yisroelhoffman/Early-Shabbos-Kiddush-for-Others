# Early-Shabbos-Kiddush-for-Others

A person can make kiddush late Friday afternoon, before nightfall, if he accepts upon himself an early Shabbos.  

If one needs to make Kiddush to fulfill the obligation for someone else but does not want to accept an early Shabbos, some poskim permit him to make Kiddush for others without personally accepting Shabbos early.
