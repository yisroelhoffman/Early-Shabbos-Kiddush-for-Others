# Early-Shabbos-Kiddush-for-Others

A person can make kiddush late on Friday afternoon, before nightfall, if he accepts an early Shabbos.  

If one needs to make Kiddush to fulfill the obligation for someone else but does not want to accept an early Shabbos, some poskim permit him to make Kiddush for others without personally accepting Shabbos early.
